Very cool and ambitious app! The code is clean and mostly DRY (I offer some modular refactors in my PR), and I wish y'all had had more time to realize more of your ambitions and flesh out the UI. As it stands, it's really cool that y'all were able to pull together so many interesting pieces (specifically, Cron jobs, push notifications), and the real accomplishment of this app seems to be the complexity of the back-end and the management of sending Nags and assigning them to users.
