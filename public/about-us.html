    <h3>"Never forget until it's <em>done.</em>"</h3><br>
    <p>The app you see before you was a dream. A dream where everyone remembered to do <em><b>everything</b></em>. Sound like a dream you've ever had? Welcome to NAGME.</p><br>
    <h3><b>Our Humble Beginnings</b></h3>
    <p>Just like any other great story or idea, NAGME comes from humble beginnings. Our founder, Casey, wanted a simple way to remind himself to take out the trash without bothering his wife to remind him. So he created a system to remind himself to do simple tasks.</p>
        <br>
            <h3>The Day Dreaming About Nags Became A Reality</h3>
        <p>In the fall of 2019, the "dotPush" team was formed to create NAGME as a class project. </p>

                <h1>Casey</h1>
                <p>Casey has mixed feelings about Costco. Going  often helps him work through his emotions. His favorite nag is the classic 'take out the trash.'  <em>"A certain someone in my life is fond of saying 'it's garbage day' to which I reply 'it's garbage day EVE' (because my nag is set for the day before)."</em></p>
